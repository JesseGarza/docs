#### \-\-index

Filename of the home page, defaults to `index.html`. This is useful if
- your web server expects another file name
- you already have an `index.html` and want to galleries to sit next to it

#### \-\-albums-output-folder

The default is for all HTML pages to sit at the root of the gallery.
This setting lets you group albums into a subfolder, so that the output looks like:

```
output
  |__ index.html
  |__ albums
  |   |__ holidays.html
  |   |__ birthdays.html
  |__ media
  |   |__ photo0001.jpg
  |   |__ photo0002.jpg
  |__ public
      |__ styles.css
```

This can help keep the output folder clean.
All relative links are still maintained for local browsing.
This setting does not affect the `index.html` page.

#### \-\-theme

Specifies the theme to apply: `classic`, `cards`, `mosaic`.
See the [themes](../../4-themes/themes) section for more information.

#### \-\-title

Website title. Defaults to "Photo album".

#### \-\-footer

This file is included after all other styles so you can override any particular style from the themes.
