You can select a theme for the gallery with `--theme`.
Themes change the final layout of the galleries, but don't impact the way thumbnails are generated.

```bash
# load one of the built-in themes
--theme <name>

# load an external theme
â€”-theme file://path/to/theme
```

You can look at [built-in themes](../built-in/) or [create your own](../create/).
